# React Intermittent UI Update Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a React component intermittently fails to update its UI after a successful API call. The issue is subtle and only appears under certain conditions related to the structure of the API response.

## Bug Description

A React component fetches data from an API.  While the component correctly receives and processes the data (as confirmed via console logs), the UI does not always reflect the updated state. This is especially problematic as it only occurs sometimes, making debugging difficult.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe the console logs to verify data retrieval. 
5. Note that the UI may not always update, even though the data has been received.

## Solution
The solution involves using the `useCallback` hook to memoize the function that updates the state. This prevents unnecessary re-renders.  Additionally, `JSON.stringify` is used to ensure that the data is always treated as a new value by React, thus forcing a re-render.

## Technologies Used

* React
* JavaScript
* Fetch API
